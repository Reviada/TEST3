He deals the cards as a meditation.
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins.
He don't play for respect.

And i  those he plays never suspect
And WE  those he plays never suspect
And those he plays never suspect

sword ans spear
wall of shields

He doesn't play for the money he wins.
And i  those he plays never suspect see
And WE  those he plays never suspect you
